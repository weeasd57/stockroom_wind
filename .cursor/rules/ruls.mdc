üîß Cursor AI Assistant Rules

üó£Ô∏è Communication
- Speak Arabic (Egyptian dialect) when explaining concepts.
- dont write arabic in files project .
- Provide step-by-step explanations with clarity.
- Suggest better system designs and algorithms, not just code fixes.
- Respect the existing codebase structure and coding style.


‚ö° Next.js Specific Rules
- Always handle server-side rendering (SSR) vs client-side rendering (CSR) differences.
- Use `"use client"` directive for components that need browser APIs.
- Implement proper hydration strategies for authentication providers.
- Handle middleware authentication checks properly for API routes.
- Use dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for client-only components when needed.
- Monitor and debug useEffect execution in both server and client contexts.
- Implement fallback loading states for client-side mounted components.

üö´ Constraints
- Do NOT run or suggest running a local server.
- Avoid installing unnecessary dependencies unless clearly justified.
- Never ignore hydration mismatches - always fix them properly.

üß† Clarity & Documentation
- Include comments in code examples to explain logic.
- Suggest better naming conventions and improve code readability.
- Break large logic blocks into small, purposeful functions.
- Ensure that added providers or wrappers are well-documented and easy to maintain.
- Document authentication flow and state management clearly.

üí° Code Quality & Design
- Follow React and Next.js best practices.
- Use modern, responsive, clean architecture for frontend and backend.
- Write modular, reusable, and well-structured components.
- Follow SOLID and DRY principles.
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript syntax (ES6+).
- Avoid anti-patterns; suggest cleaner alternatives.
- Add appropriate **providers** (e.g., Context, Zustand, Redux) to manage and persist state efficiently.
- Ensure providers are placed logically in the app tree to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

üîê Security & Error Handling
- Apply security best practices (e.g. XSS, CSRF protection, input sanitization).
- Always suggest secure and defensive coding techniques.
- Provide robust and clear error-handling strategies with fallback UIs/messages.

‚ö° Performance Optimization
- Optimize code for runtime performance and scalability.
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders and optimize rendering logic.
- Recommend best caching and data-fetching strategies (ISR, SSG, SSR).
- Use memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) where appropriate.
- Detect and reduce memory leaks or bottlenecks.
- Suggest performance-optimized state management strategies (e.g., selective re-rendering, atomic stores).

üîé Testing & Edge Case Coverage
- Identify edge cases and validate inputs properly.
- Suggest appropriate unit, integration, and E2E testing strategies.
- Recommend tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright, or Cypress.

üß™ Testing & Development
- Use `curl` commands to test API endpoints and server responses.
- Always verify authentication states with browser console logs.
- Test client-side hydration by checking browser Developer Tools (F12).
- Use browser preview tools instead of `curl` for full JavaScript applications.
- Monitor server-side vs client-side rendering issues carefully.
- Validate real-time subscriptions and WebSocket connections.

üì° Comprehensive Curl Testing Commands
- **Home Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000` (Should return 200 OK)
- **Landing Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/landing` (Should return 200 OK)  
- **Login Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/login` (Should return 200 OK)
- **Traders Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/traders` (Should return 200 OK)
- **Profile Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/profile` (Should return 200 OK)
- **Pricing Page**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/pricing` (Should return 200 OK)
- **API Subscription**: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/subscription/info` (Should return 401 Unauthorized when not logged in)
- **API Health Check**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health` (If health endpoint exists)
- **Authentication Callback**: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (Should return 200 OK)
- **Content Security Policy**: Check CSP headers in curl responses for security compliance
- **Response Times**: Monitor response times for performance issues (should be under 5 seconds)
- **Error Pages**: Test 404 routes with `curl -I http://localhost:3000/nonexistent` (Should return 404)

ü§ñ Automated Testing Protocol
- **ALWAYS implement automated self-testing** for any new feature or background function
- **DO NOT ask user to run console commands** - create automated test functions instead
- **Auto-validate** all background processes (profile edit, price checks, post creation, etc.)
- **Implement error recovery** with automatic retry mechanisms
- **Monitor console outputs** and handle errors programmatically
- **Create test scenarios** that simulate real user interactions
- **Add debug modes** with comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Use synthetic test data** when real data is not available
- **Implement health checks** for all critical background functions
- **Auto-report test results** with clear pass/fail status and error details

üîÑ Background Function Testing Requirements
- **Profile Edit Testing**: Auto-test avatar upload, background upload, profile data saving
- **Price Check Testing**: Auto-test API calls, data parsing, database updates
- **Post Creation Testing**: Auto-test image compression, content validation, database insertion
- **Subscription Testing**: Auto-test plan limits, usage tracking, billing status
- **Authentication Testing**: Auto-test login flows, session management, token refresh
- **API Integration Testing**: Auto-test all external API endpoints with mock data
- **Database Testing**: Auto-test CRUD operations with transaction rollback
- **Error Handling Testing**: Auto-test failure scenarios and recovery mechanisms

üéØ Testing Automation Strategy
- **Self-contained tests** that run without user intervention
- **Mock external dependencies** to ensure reliable testing
- **Automatic test execution** on feature implementation
- **Comprehensive error reporting** with actionable insights
- **Performance benchmarking** with automatic alerts for degradation
- **Cross-browser compatibility** testing for frontend features
- **Load testing** for backend functions under stress
- **Security testing** for authentication and authorization flows
